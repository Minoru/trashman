How to get all this stuff to work

Firstly, you need to change mountpoint and cddev variables in the addcd script.
Read note at the beginning of the script to figure out what do you need to
assign to this variables.

Then, if you want, change db variable (you need to do it in _all_ scripts) -
database location stored there.

Finally, move scripts to any directory mentioned in your $PATH environment
variable. Alternatively, you can create new directory (say, scripts) in your
home directory (or somewhere else) and add it to the $PATH.

Don't forget to check out repository sometimes!

With my best regards,
